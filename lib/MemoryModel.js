	FUTUR FEATURE!
	
	Load a part of the DB in memory, and produce an efficient and useful data model.
	It's built on top of Batch: the MemoryModel contains one Batch per Collection, and it act exactly like a local database.
	All linked document will be loaded in the batch of the appropriate collection, those links will be replaced by reference
	of the real document.
	Later, the whole data of the MemoryModel can be saved.
	
	The key point of this feature is that the data model should be exactly what one would expect from a program that works
	without database.
	
	Also it has index-like feature.
	A basic batch is only a big array: not that useful in many case.
	So to improve things, one may access a document using e.g. the ObjectID, using `batch.$.id[ id ]`, that's a map with
	the ObjectID as a key and a reference to the document as the value.
	For games, a 2D index can be produced, e.g. using `batch.$.cell[ x ][ y ]`.
	
	Use case: game.
	One node instance load a whole Level, and load any characters, NPCs, weapon drop, area effect (and so on) that are currently
	tied to that Level.
	A character can only be on one Level at a time, so no data are replicated in another instance.
	Once a character leave the Level, it is unloaded and saved back to the database.
	Once in a time, all document of the Level are saved (to prevent a crash of the node instance).
