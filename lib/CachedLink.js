	FUTUR FEATURE!

	If a property has the 'cachedLink' option, then it contains the whole target document.
	It is first populated the first time a .getLink() is called upon it, after that, .getLink() will always return the local copy,
	except if a 'force' option is passed, in this case a new request is performed and populate the cache with fresh data.

	The target document may have a 'populateBackLink' option.
	In that case, any modifications to it will remove or update any cachedLink.

	The target document has a 'lastModified' timestamp, thus the cachedLink has it too.

	It is possible to use this timestamp as the update mechanism, in that case any .getLink() attempt will check that timestamp,
	and if it's too old, will update the data.
